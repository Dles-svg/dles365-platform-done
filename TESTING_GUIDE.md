## What You Should See

### On Gamer's Screen
- ✅ Video preview of what you're sharing
- ✅ Red "LIVE" badge
- ✅ Connection status: "✓ Connected" (green)
- ✅ Viewer count updating (should show "1" when miner joins)
- ✅ "BETA TESTING MODE" banner (no charges)

### On Miner's Screen
- ✅ Live video stream from gamer
- ✅ "✓ Connected" status (green)
- ✅ "FREE BETA TEST" indicator
- ✅ Viewer count
- ✅ Stream title and description
- ✅ Chat interface (right side)

## Connection Status Indicators

Both broadcaster and viewer now show real-time connection status:

| Status | Meaning | Color |
|--------|---------|-------|
| ✓ Connected | Streaming working perfectly | Green |
| ⟳ Connecting... | Establishing connection | Blue |
| ✗ Connection Failed | Unable to connect (firewall/NAT issue) | Red |
| ○ Disconnected | Connection lost | Gray |
| ○ Ready/Initializing | Waiting to start | Gray |

## Troubleshooting

### "No streams showing up"
- Make sure gamer clicked "Start Broadcasting"
- Verify both users are signed in
- Check that user roles match (gamer sees gaming streams, miner sees gaming streams)
- Refresh the page

### "Connection Failed" or stuck on "Connecting..."
- Try different network (mobile hotspot, different WiFi)
- Check firewall settings (may need to allow WebRTC)
- This affects ~10-20% of connections (normal with STUN-only setup)
- When TURN server is added, this will be solved

### "No video showing"
- Check camera/screen permissions in browser
- Click on video player to unmute
- Verify gamer granted screen sharing access
- Try refreshing the viewer's page

### "Viewer count not updating"
- Give it 2-3 seconds to sync
- Check database connection
- Refresh both pages

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Test 1: Same Network
- Both computers on same WiFi
- **Expected:** Should work 100% of the time

### Test 2: Different Networks
- Gamer on WiFi, Miner on mobile hotspot
- **Expected:** Should work 90%+ of the time

### Test 3: Corporate/School Network
- One or both on restricted network
- **Expected:** May fail 30-40% (TURN server needed for production)

### Test 4: Multiple Viewers
- Have 2-3 miners watch same stream
- **Expected:** All should connect successfully
- Viewer count should show correct number

## Current Limitations (Beta)

1. **No coin charging** - Streaming is 100% free during beta
2. **No TURN fallback** - ~10-20% connections may fail on strict networks
3. **Quality auto-detected** - No manual quality selection yet
4. **No recording** - Streams are live-only
5. **Browser refresh needed** - If connection drops, refresh page

## What's Working Now

✅ Real-time P2P streaming via WebRTC
✅ Screen/camera capture on gamer side
✅ Live viewer count updates
✅ Connection status indicators
✅ Chat functionality
✅ Both web and desktop apps functional
✅ Multiple viewers per stream
✅ Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
✅ Sub-2-second latency
✅ FREE for testing (no DL365 charges)
