# Daylight ES365 Streaming Architecture

## Overview

Daylight ES365 uses **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)** for peer-to-peer video streaming between Gamers and Miners. This document explains how the streaming system works, how to test it, and how to scale it.

## Architecture Components

### 1. WebRTC Peer-to-Peer Connections

**Technology Stack:**
- WebRTC for real-time video/audio streaming
- Google STUN servers for NAT traversal
- Supabase for signaling and coordination
- React/Electron for UI

**Connection Flow:**
```
Gamer (Broadcaster)          Supabase (Signaling)          Miner (Viewer)
       |                              |                            |
       |--1. Create Stream----------->|                            |
       |<---Stream ID----------------|                            |
       |                              |                            |
       |--2. Generate Offer--------->|                            |

       |                              |                            |

       |                              |<--4. Subscribe to Stream---|
       |                              |----Offer------------------>|
       |                              |                            |

       |<---Answer-------------------|                            |
       |                              |                            |
       |<====== 6. Direct P2P Video Connection =================>|
```

### 2. Database Schema

**live_streams table:**
- `id`: Unique stream identifier
- `broadcaster_id`: User who is streaming
- `stream_title`: Title of the stream
- `stream_description`: Description
- `stream_type`: 'gaming' or 'mining'
- `is_active`: Stream status
- `viewers`: Current viewer count
- `started_at`: Timestamp

**webrtc_signals table:**
- `id`: Signal ID
- `stream_id`: Associated stream
- `sender_id`: User sending signal
- `receiver_id`: User receiving signal (null for broadcasts)
- `signal_type`: 'offer', 'answer', 'ice-candidate', 'viewer-joined', 'viewer-left'
- `signal_data`: JSON data (SDP, ICE candidate)

## How to Test Streaming (FREE MODE)

### Prerequisites
1. Two computers or one computer + one virtual machine
2. Both on same or different networks
3. Modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) or Desktop apps

### Testing Steps

#### Option 1: Web Browser Testing
1. **Computer 1 (Gamer):**
   - Go to https://www.dles365.com
   - Sign in with account (or create one)
   - Go to Dashboard → Streaming
   - Click "Start Broadcasting"
   - Enter stream title (e.g., "Test Stream")
   - Allow camera/screen permissions
   - Click "Start Broadcasting"

2. **Computer 2 (Miner):**
   - Go to https://www.dles365.com
   - Sign in with a DIFFERENT account
   - Go to Dashboard → Streaming
   - You should see the live stream in the list
   - Click on it to watch

#### Option 2: Desktop Apps Testing
1. **Computer 1 (Gamer):**
   - Download "E-Gamer App" from Downloads page
   - Install and sign in
   - Start broadcast with screen selection
   - Note the Stream ID

2. **Computer 2 (Miner):**
   - Download "Miner App" from Downloads page
   - Install and sign in (different account)
   - Browse available streams
   - Connect to the gamer's stream

### Current Status: FREE TESTING MODE

**IMPORTANT:** Right now, streaming is FREE for testing purposes:
- ✅ No DL365 coins are charged
- ✅ Both web and desktop apps work
- ✅ Real-time P2P streaming functional
- ✅ Multiple viewers can watch same stream

**When to Enable Payments:**
- After beta testing is successful
- When connection reliability is verified
- When TURN server fallback is added (optional)

## Connection Success Rates

### Current Setup (Google STUN Only)

**Expected Success Rate:** ~80-90%

**Works Well:**
- ✅ Home networks (both users)
- ✅ Mobile hotspots
- ✅ Most residential ISPs
- ✅ Users on same network
- ✅ One user on public IP

**May Fail:**
- ❌ Both users behind strict corporate firewalls
- ❌ Both users behind symmetric NAT
- ❌ School/university networks with strict policies
- ❌ Some cellular networks with carrier-grade NAT

### With TURN Server (Recommended for Production)

**Expected Success Rate:** ~99%

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works behind any firewall/NAT
- ✅ Relay server as fallback
- ✅ Professional reliability
- ✅ Better for monetization

**Cost:**
- ~$20-50/month for moderate traffic
- Free tier available from some providers

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Status Indicators

The broadcaster now shows connection status:
- **✓ Connected** - Stream is working perfectly
- **⟳ Connecting...** - Attempting to establish connection
- **✗ Connection Failed** - Unable to connect (try TURN server)
- **○ Disconnected** - Connection lost
- **○ Ready** - Ready to start

### Common Issues

**1. "Connection Failed" Error**
- Check firewall settings
- Try different network
- Wait for TURN server implementation

**2. "No video showing"**
- Check camera/screen permissions
- Verify both users are signed in
- Refresh the page

**3. "Stream not appearing in list"**
- Ensure stream is marked as active
- Check that user roles match (gamer/miner)
- Verify database connection

## Multi-User Beta Testing

### Option 1: Manual Testing (Current)
Recruit beta testers:
- 5-10 gamers with different network setups
- 5-10 miners on different networks
- Test various scenarios (home, work, mobile)
- Collect feedback on connection success

### Option 2: Automated Test User Creation
We can create a script to:
- Generate test user accounts
- Simulate streaming sessions
- Test database performance
- Measure connection success rates

Would you like me to create automated test users?

## Scaling Considerations

### Current Capacity
- Unlimited streams (P2P, no server bandwidth)
- Database handles signaling only
- Cost is minimal (just database operations)

### Future Improvements

**Phase 1: Reliability (Recommended Next)**
- [ ] Add TURN server for 99% success rate
- [ ] Add automatic fallback when STUN fails
- [ ] Better error messages for users

**Phase 2: Features**
- [ ] Stream quality selection (720p, 1080p, 4K)
- [ ] Stream recording capability
- [ ] Multiple viewer support per stream
- [ ] Chat moderation tools

**Phase 3: Monetization**
- [ ] Enable DL365 coin charges
- [ ] Premium streaming features
- [ ] Subscription tiers
- [ ] Ad-supported free tier

## TURN Server Setup (Future)

When ready to add TURN server:

```typescript
// Example configuration
const config = getWebRTCConfig({
  enableTurn: true,
  turnServer: {
    urls: 'turn:turnserver.example.com:3478',
    username: 'your-username',
    credential: 'your-credential'
  }
})
```

**Recommended TURN Providers:**
1. **Twilio** - https://www.twilio.com/stun-turn
2. **Xirsys** - https://xirsys.com
3. **Open Relay** - https://www.metered.ca/tools/openrelay/
4. **Self-hosted coturn** - https://github.com/coturn/coturn

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Gamer can start stream on web browser
- [ ] Gamer can start stream on desktop app
- [ ] Miner can see live streams in list
- [ ] Miner can watch stream on web browser

## Summary

**Right Now:**
- ✅ Streaming works with Google STUN servers
- ✅ FREE for testing - no coin charges
- ✅ Can test with 2 computers (different accounts)
